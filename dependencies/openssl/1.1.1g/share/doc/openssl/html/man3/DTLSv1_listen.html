<p>SSL_stateless,
DTLSv1_listen
- Statelessly listen for incoming connections</p>

 #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;</pre>

<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><code>SSL_stateless()</code> statelessly listens for new incoming TLSv1.3 connections.
DTLSv1_listen() statelessly listens for new incoming DTLS connections. If a
ClientHello is received that does not contain a cookie, then they respond with a
request for a new ClientHello that does contain a cookie. If a ClientHello is
received with a cookie that is verified then the function returns in order to
enable the handshake to be completed (for example by using SSL_accept()).</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="notes">NOTES</a></h1>
<p>Some transport protocols (such as UDP) can be susceptible to amplification
attacks. Unlike TCP there is no initial connection setup in UDP that
validates that the client can actually receive messages on its advertised source
address. An attacker could forge its source IP address and then send handshake
initiation messages to the server. The server would then send its response to
the forged source IP. If the response messages are larger than the original
message then the amplification attack has succeeded.</p>
<p>If DTLS is used over UDP (or any datagram based protocol that does not validate
the source IP) then it is susceptible to this type of attack. TLSv1.3 is
designed to operate over a stream-based transport protocol (such as TCP).
If TCP is being used then there is no need to use <code>SSL_stateless()</code>. However some
stream-based transport protocols (e.g. QUIC) may not validate the source
address. In this case a TLSv1.3 application would be susceptible to this attack.</p>
<p>As a countermeasure to this issue TLSv1.3 and DTLS include a stateless cookie
mechanism. The idea is that when a client attempts to connect to a server it
sends a ClientHello message. The server responds with a HelloRetryRequest (in
TLSv1.3) or a HelloVerifyRequest (in DTLS) which contains a unique cookie. The
client then resends the ClientHello, but this time includes the cookie in the
message thus proving that the client is capable of receiving messages sent to
that address. All of this can be done by the server without allocating any
state, and thus without consuming expensive resources.</p>
<p>OpenSSL implements this capability via the <code>SSL_stateless()</code> and DTLSv1_listen()
functions. The <strong>ssl</strong> parameter should be a newly allocated SSL object with its
read and write BIOs set, in the same way as might be done for a call to
<code>SSL_accept()</code>. Typically, for DTLS, the read BIO will be in an &quot;unconnected&quot;
state and thus capable of receiving messages from any peer.</p>
<p>When a ClientHello is received that contains a cookie that has been verified,
then these functions will return with the <strong>ssl</strong> parameter updated into a state
where the handshake can be continued by a call to (for example) <code>SSL_accept()</code>.
Additionally, for DTLSv1_listen(), the <strong>BIO_ADDR</strong> pointed to by <strong>peer</strong> will be
filled in with details of the peer that sent the ClientHello. If the underlying
BIO is unable to obtain the <strong>BIO_ADDR</strong> of the peer (for example because the BIO
does not support this), then <strong>*peer</strong> will be cleared and the family set to
AF_UNSPEC. Typically user code is expected to &quot;connect&quot; the underlying socket to
the peer and continue the handshake in a connected state.</p>
<p>Prior to calling DTLSv1_listen() user code must ensure that cookie generation
and verification callbacks have been set up using
<em>SSL_CTX_set_cookie_generate_cb(3)</em> and <em>SSL_CTX_set_cookie_verify_cb(3)</em>
respectively. For <code>SSL_stateless()</code>, <em>SSL_CTX_set_stateless_cookie_generate_cb(3)</em>
and <em>SSL_CTX_set_stateless_cookie_verify_cb(3)</em> must be used instead.</p>
<p>Since DTLSv1_listen() operates entirely statelessly whilst processing incoming
ClientHellos it is unable to process fragmented messages (since this would
require the allocation of state). An implication of this is that DTLSv1_listen()
<strong>only</strong> supports ClientHellos that fit inside a single datagram.</p>
<p>For <code>SSL_stateless()</code> if an entire ClientHello message cannot be read without the
&quot;read&quot; BIO becoming empty then the <code>SSL_stateless()</code> call will fail. It is the
application's responsibility to ensure that data read from the &quot;read&quot; BIO during
a single <code>SSL_stateless()</code> call is all from the same peer.</p>
<p><code>SSL_stateless()</code> will fail (with a 0 return value) if some TLS version less than
TLSv1.3 is used.</p>
<p>Both <code>SSL_stateless()</code> and DTLSv1_listen() will clear the error queue when they
start.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="return_values">RETURN VALUES</a></h1>
<p>For <code>SSL_stateless()</code> a return value of 1 indicates success and the <strong>ssl</strong> object
will be set up ready to continue the handshake. A return value of 0 or -1
indicates failure. If the value is 0 then a HelloRetryRequest was sent. A value
of -1 indicates any other error. User code may retry the <code>SSL_stateless()</code> call.</p>
<p>For DTLSv1_listen() a return value of &gt;= 1 indicates success. The <strong>ssl</strong> object
will be set up ready to continue the handshake.  the <strong>peer</strong> value will also be
filled in.</p>
<p>A return value of 0 indicates a non-fatal error. This could (for
example) be because of non-blocking IO, or some invalid message having been
received from a peer. Errors may be placed on the OpenSSL error queue with
further information if appropriate. Typically user code is expected to retry the
call to DTLSv1_listen() in the event of a non-fatal error.</p>
<p>A return value of &lt;0 indicates a fatal error. This could (for example) be
because of a failure to allocate sufficient memory for the operation.</p>
<p>For DTLSv1_listen(), prior to OpenSSL 1.1.0, fatal and non-fatal errors both
produce return codes &lt;= 0 (in typical implementations user code treats all
errors as non-fatal), whilst return codes &gt;0 indicate success.</p>

<h1><a name="history">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p>The <code>SSL_stateless()</code> function was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.</p>
<p>The DTLSv1_listen() return codes were clarified in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
The type of &quot;peer&quot; also changed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.</p>
